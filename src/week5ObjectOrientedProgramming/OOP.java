	/*
	 * Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
	 * 
	 * **Examples of Objects
	 * DVD Player
	 * 	- Properties
	 * 		- Height
	 * 		- Weight
	 * 		- Width
	 * 		- Color
	 *	- Functionality
	 *		- Play
	 *		- Fast Forward
	 *		- Rewind
	 *		- Pause
	 * 
	 * DVD
	 * 	- Properties
	 * 		- Movie Length
	 * 		- Image
	 * 		- Size
	 * 	- Functionality
	 * 		- Store
	 * 		
	 * ******* Four Pillars of OOP:
	 * 1. Abstraction
	 * 		Exposing essential features of an entity or object while hiding the details that don't matter as much or change from implementation to implementation
	 * 		ex. - Triangle - abstract because we know what a triangle is, but we don't know the angles or side length of the triangle in general
	 * 		ex.	- Table - abstract because we know what a table is but not the specific details
	 * 
	 * 2. Encapsulation
	 * 		Hiding the inner workings of our code so it cannot be searched and modified or manipulated
	 * 		ex. - Driving a car - don't need to know how the car is handling things as you tell it where to go and how fast to go
	 * 				Inner workings such as how the engine is working are Private
	 * 
	 * 3. Inheritance
	 * 		Allows objects or classes to inherit from parent classes
	 * 		Just like inheriting traits from our parents - OOP allows objects to inherit from parent objects (classes)
	 * 		The child class inherits behavior from the parent class
	 * 		Java doesn't support multiple Class inheritance - called Diamond Problem
	 * 		Java does allow multiple Interfaces
	 * 		Useful for reducing duplicated code
	 * 
	 *  
	 * 4. Polymorphism
	 * 		Something can take different forms
	 * 		ex. Animals communicate in different ways
	 * 			- the "method" Communicate can take different forms
	 * 			- each animal's implementation of Communicate would be different
	 * 	 
	 * ******** Structuring Code
	 * Class - how we structure our code in OOP
	 * 		Class is a like a blueprint or template
	 * 		Object is the actual product (Instance) developed from the blueprint
	 * 		An Object is an Instance of a Class
	 *
